## Cybersecurity & Data Engineering student

### Software Development & early Cybersecurity
I started to write code with blocks in middle school, eventually moving into JS later on in high school, By the end of my Senior year of high school I had at least a year of experience writing code with JS, HTML5 and CSS3, at the time we would use \[Brackets\]. I graduated high school June 2021 moving into College where I initiated my experience with OOP (Fall 2021) along with Cybersecurity fundamentals (CompTIA Sec+). My OOP initiation involved Python and Java where eventually we decided to peruse the mastery of OOP through the PCAP certification where we extensively engaged in Class Inheritance, Super Classes, Advanced objects and the 4 Pillars of OOP: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. 

### Cybersecurity foundation & Data Engineering 
While perusing the PCAP certification we also engaged in System Administration, Network Security and Cybersecurity experience through our internship at WestStar Bank, working with the beautiful team and staff at WestStar we have learned from Cybersecurity administration to System/Environmental Architecture, Server Migrations, Cloud API integrations, Federal audits and compliance, etc. please feel free to ask me anything about these topics and anything related to these topics I will be more than happy to answer them.

<!-- * üß†¬† I'm working on [The-Sequence-Of-Nature](https://github.com/Esprij/The-Sequence-Of-Nature) web-app that involves extensive Singal Processing using Python and a Full Stack Archtitecture, a collaborative project with: [@EmiRodr1guez](https://github.com/EmiRodr1guez). As well as an Analysis on the Space Race, comming soon. Eventually I plan on working on Tensorflow projects to familiarize myself with ML models and Neural Networks. -->
